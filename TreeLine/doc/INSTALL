TreeLine Installation Notes

Extract the source files from the treeline tar file, then change to the
'TreeLine' directory in a terminal.  For a basic installation, simply
execute the following command as root:  'python install.py'

If your distribution defaults to Python 2.x, you may need to substitute
"python3", "python3.2" or "python3.3" for "python" in these commands.

To see all install options, use: 'python install.py -h'.  To install
TreeLine with a different prefix (the default is '/usr/local'), use:
'python install.py -p /prefix/path'.
